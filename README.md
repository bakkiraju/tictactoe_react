# tictactoe_react
tictactoe implementation based on facebook's react tutorial


Key concepts:

Pure Components : 
  - State of the component is immutable

Stateless Functional Components : 

    - only consist of a render method
    - Rather than define a class extending React.Component, write a function that takes props 
      and returns what should be rendered.
